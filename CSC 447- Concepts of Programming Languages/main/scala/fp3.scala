/* INSTRUCTIONS
 *
 * Complete the exercises below.  For each "EXERCISE" comment, add
 * code immediately below the comment.
 *
 * Please see README.md for instructions, including compilation and testing.
 * 
 * GRADING
 * 
 * 1. Submissions MUST compile using SBT with UNCHANGED configuration and tests with no
 *    compilation errors.  Submissions with compilation errors will receive 0 points.
 *    Note that refactoring the code will cause the tests to fail.
 *
 * 2. You MUST NOT edit the SBT configuration and tests.  Altering it in your submission will
 *    result in 0 points for this assignment.
 *
 * 3. You MUST NOT use while loops or (re)assignment to variables (you can use "val" declarations,
 *    but not "var" declarations).  You must use recursion instead.
 *
 * 4. You may declare auxiliary functions if you like.
 *
 * SUBMISSION
 *
 * 1. Upload this file to D2L before the deadline.
 *
 * 2. Late submissions will not be permitted because solutions will be discussed in class.

  // EXERCISE 1: complete the following recursive definition of a "member" function 
  // to check whether an element "a" is a member of a list of integers "xs".
  // Your implementation of "member" MUST be recursive and not use the builtin "contains" method from the List class.
  // EXAMPLES: 
  // - member (5, List (4, 6, 8, 5)) == true
  // - member (3, List (4, 6, 8, 5)) == false
  def member (a : Int, xs : List[Int]) : Boolean = {
    xs match{
	case Nil => false
	case y::ys => if (y == a) true 
	else member(a,ys)
	}
	    
  }

  // EXERCISE 2: complete the following recursive definition of an "allEqual" function
  // to check whether all elements in a list of integers are equal.
  // EXAMPLES:
  // - allEqual (Nil) == true
  // - allEqual (List (5)) == true
  // - allEqual (List (5, 5, 5)) == true
  // - allEqual (List (6, 5, 5, 5)) == false
  // - allEqual (List (5, 5, 6, 5)) == false
  // - allEqual (List (5, 5, 5, 6)) == false
  def allEqual (xs : List[Int]) : Boolean = {    
	xs match {
	case Nil => true
	case y::Nil => true
	case y::ys => if (y != ys.head) false
	else allEqual(ys)
	}
  }

  // EXERCISE 3: complete the definition of the following function that computes the length of
	// each String in a list, and returns the original Strings paired with their length.
  // For example:
  // 
  //   stringLengths (List ("the", "rain")) == List (("the", 3), ("rain", 4))
  //
  // You must not use recursion directly in the function.  You can use the "map" method 
  // of the List class.
  def stringLengths (xs:List[String]) : List[(String, Int)] = {  
    xs.map(x=>(x,x.length))
  }

  // EXERCISE 4: complete the function definition for "delete1" that takes
  // an element "x" and a list "ys", then returns the list where any
  // occurrences of "x" in "ys" have been removed.  Your definition of
  // "delete1" MUST be recursive.
  // EXAMPLE:
  // - delete1 ("the", List ("the","the","was","a","product","of","the","1980s")) == List ("was","a","product","of","1980s")
  def delete1 [X] (x:X, ys:List[X]) : List[X] = {
    ys match{
	case Nil => Nil
	case y::yz => if (y == x) delete1(x,yz)
	else y :: delete1(x,yz)
	}
  }

  // EXERCISE 5: complete the function definition for "delete2" below.  It must 
  // have the same behavior as "delete1".  It must be written using "for comprehensions" 
  // and not use recursion explicitly.
  def delete2 [X] (x:X, ys:List[X]) : List[X] = {
    for (y <- ys; if (y != x)) yield y
    
  }

  // EXERCISE 6: complete the function definition for "delete3" below.  It must 
  // have the same behavior as "delete1".  It must be written using the
  // builtin "filter" method for Lists and not use recursion explicitly.
  def delete3 [X] (x:X, ys:List[X]) : List[X] = {
    // TODO: Provide definition here.
    ys.filter(y=>y != x)
  }

  // EXERCISE 7: complete the function definition for "removeDupes1" below.
  // It takes a list as argument, then returns the same list with
  // consecutive duplicate elements compacted to a single element.  
  // Duplicate elements that are separated by at least one distinct
  // element should be left alone.
  // EXAMPLE:
  // - removeDupes1 (List (1,1,2,3,3,3,4,4,5,6,7,7,8,9,2,2,2,9)) == List (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,2,9)
  def removeDupes1 [X] (xs:List[X]) : List[X] = {
    // TODO: Provide definition here.
    xs match{
	case Nil => Nil
	case y::Nil => y :: Nil
	case y::ys => if (y == ys.head) removeDupes1(ys)
	else y :: removeDupes1(ys)
	}
  }


  // EXERCISE 8: write a function "removeDupes2" that behaves like "removeDupes1",
  // but also includes a count of the number of consecutive duplicate
  // elements in the original list (thus producing a simple run-length
  // encoding).  The counts are paired with each element in the output
  // list.
  // EXAMPLE:
  // - removeDupes2 (List (1,1,2,3,3,3,4,4,5,6,7,7,8,9,2,2,2,9)) == List ((2,1),(1,2),(3,3),(2,4),(1,5),(1,6),(2,7),(1,8),(1,9),(3,2),(1,9))
  def removeDupes2 [X] (xs:List[X]) : List[(Int, X)] = {
    // TODO: Provide definition here.
	def Aux [X] (xs : List[X], count : Int) : List[(Int, X)] = {
    xs match {
		case Nil => Nil
		case y::Nil => (count,y) :: Nil
		case y::ys => if (y == ys.head) Aux(ys,count+1)
		else (count,y) :: Aux(ys,1)
		}
	}
	Aux(xs,1);
  }


  // EXERCISE 9: complete the following definition of a function that splits a list
  // into a pair of two lists.  The offset for the the split position is given
  // by the Int argument.
  // The behavior is determined by:
  //
  //   for all n, xs:
  //     splitAt (n, xs) == (take (n, xs), drop (n, xs))   
  //
  // Your definition of "splitAt" must be recursive and must not use "take" or "drop".
  //
  // Your definition of "splitAt" must only travere the list once.  So
  // you cannot define your own versions of "take"/"drop" and use them
  // (because that would entail one traversal of the list with "take"
  // and then a second traversal with "drop").
  def splitAt [X] (n:Int, xs:List[X]) : (List[X], List[X]) = {
    // TODO: Provide definition here.
	(n,xs) match {
	case (_,Nil) => (Nil,Nil)
	case (-1,zs) => (List(), zs)
	case (n, x :: xs) =>
		{
		val (list1,list2) = splitAt(n-1, xs)
		if (n > 0) (x :: list1,list2) else (list1,x:: list2)
		}			  
	}
  }

  // EXERCISE 10: complete the following definition of an "allDistinct" function that checks
  // whether all values in list are distinct.  You should use your "member" function defined earlier.
  // Your implementation must be recursive.
  // EXAMPLE:
  // - allDistinct (Nil) == true
  // - allDistinct (List (1,2,3,4,5)) == true
  // - allDistinct (List (1,2,3,4,5,1)) == false
  // - allDistinct (List (1,2,3,2,4,5)) == false
  def allDistinct (xs : List[Int]) : Boolean = {
    // TODO: Provide definition here.
	xs match{
     case Nil => true;	 
	 case y::ys => if (member(y,ys)) false else allDistinct(ys)
	 }
  }
}
